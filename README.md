# GMIT Programming for Data Analysis Project 2019

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with analyses of tips dataset. This is a final project for Programming for Data Analysis in the second semester of 2019.

[See here for the instructions](https://github.com/brianmcgmit/ProgDA/raw/master/ProgDA_Project.pdf)

## The main goal and the key points

Create a data set by simulating a free choice of real-world phenomenon. 
Instead of collecting real data related to the phenomenon, the data should be modelled and synthesised by using Python.

The main goals for this project:

* Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
* Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other
* Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
* Use a Jupyter notebook for research and implement the simulation inside

## How to run code the in Jupyter Notebook

There are couple of ways to view and run notebook.

   1. The file can be downloaded locally and run on the PC with Jupyter Notebook installed
   2. It can be viewed in the web browser on the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/G00376332/52465_Project/blob/master/Project_PFDA.ipynb)
   3. Directrly on the [GitHub](https://github.com/G00376332/52465_Project/blob/master/Project_PFDA.ipynb)

### How to install Jupyter Notebook

The most convenient way to quickly install Jupyter Notebook is the use of Anaconda package.  
Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

Use the following installation steps:

Download Anaconda. Is recommend downloading Anacondaâ€™s latest Python 3 version (currently Python 3.7).
Install the version of Anaconda which was downloaded, following the instructions on the download page.

To run the notebook type in the cmd or commander:
 **jupyter notebook**
